      <h1>Hello, I'm <a href="http://seantaylor.work/">Sean Taylor</a></h1>

      <p>This is a collection of guiding principles<sup>*</sup> I use to inform how I work, what I work on and who I work with.</p>

      <p><b>It’s a trigger for experiences</b><br>
      <i>“Stop thinking about art works as objects, and start thinking about them as triggers for experiences.”</i> - <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/05/15/brian-eno-diary-art/">Brian Eno</a><br></p>
      <p>As we move from the <a href="http://a16z.com/2016/06/07/kevin-kelly-inevitable/">internet of information</a>, it’s no longer enough to make shinier things. We need to cultivate meaningful, generous experiences.</p>

      <p><b>What’s Your Problem?</b><br>
      <i>"I’m Winston Wolfe. I solve problems.”</i> - <a href="https://youtu.be/wWmRTjLRMfU">Winston Wolfe</a><br></p>
      <p>Leading is not about <a href="http://ryanholiday.net/ego-is-the-enemy-my-new-book-a-bunch-of-preorder-bonuses/">ideas, credit or gratification</a>. It’s about understanding needs, clearing paths, collecting and connecting dots, questioning assumptions, <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/boyds-law-of-iteration/">operating at tempo</a> and creating value.</p>

      <p><b>You don't know what you're doing</b><br>
      <i>"Doubt the conventional wisdom unless you can verify it with reason and experiment.”</i> - Steve Albini<br></p>
      <p>It's okay to admit that you don't hold all the anwers. It's not okay to rely on blind faith instead of systematically testing assumptions and reducing uncertainty.</p>
      <p>It’s okay to look back at yourself six months from today and be embarrassed by your naiveté. It's not okay to have wasted that period investing in the same old theories, tools, techniques, platforms and processes at the expense of continual reflection and re-education.</p>

      <p><b>A healthy lifestyle is better than a fad diet</b><br>
      <i>“Agile is not a noun, it’s an adjective”.”</i> - <a href="https://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile/">Dave Thomas</a><br></p>
      <p>It's better to be agile and lean than Agile and Lean. Work at pace, apply common sense and use the right tool for <i>your</i> job. The goal is testing and capturing value, not ticking boxes or keeping busy.</p>

      <p><b>Stop Just Making Stuff</b><br>
      <i>"It ain’t what you do (it’s the way that you do it).”</i> - <a href="https://youtu.be/DQ9DrReE-uo">The Fun Boy Three with Bananarama</a><br></p>
      <p>There are now infinite makers of anything and infinite markets of everything. Ideas are cheap, shiny things are even cheaper. Strong ideals, excellent taste, great execution, rapid iteration and exceptional production values now  make the difference.</p>

      <p><b>Keep asking "Why?"</b><br>
      <i>"There is no way out, we must continue the whirl of reorientation, mismatches, analyses/synthesis over and over again ad infinitum.”</i> - <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2014/09/15/ooda-loop/">John Boyd</a><br></p>
      <p>Keep asking <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/11/five-whys.html">"why?"</a> and resist the comforting shelter of orthodox patterns, prescriptions and assumptions.</p>
      <p>- Observe: use situational awareness and judgement to understand a situation as it is, rather than it should be.<br>- Orient: continually question assumptions and existing paradigms to form a clear perspective of the current reality.<br>- Decide: don’t wait for the perfect answer to present itself, proceed with the best educated guess, based on the (acknowledged) imperfect information available.<br>- Act: move decisively to test assumptions, discover meanings and capture value.</p>

      <p><b>Expensive is cheap</b><br>
      <i>"If you give a good idea to a mediocre team, they will screw it up. If you give a mediocre idea to a brilliant team, they will either fix it or throw it away and come up with something better.”</i> - <a href="http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/216369/creativity-inc-by-ed-catmull-with-amy-wallace/9780812993011/">Ed Catmull</a><br></p>
      <p>Work with the best people. Support the best missions. Optimise for impact and value rather than time and cost. Efficiency is a goal but it’s not <i>the</i> goal.</p>

      <p><b>You need a compass, not a map</b><br>
      <i>"I’m making explorations. I don’t know where they’re going to take... I want to map new terrain rather than chart old landmarks... As an investigator, I have no fixed point of view, no commitment to any theory — my own or anyone else’s...<br><br>The better part of my work on media is actually somewhat like a safe-cracker’s. I don’t know what’s inside; maybe it’s nothing. I just sit down and start to work. I grope, I listen, I test, I accept and discard; I try out different sequences – until the tumblers fall and the doors spring open.”</i> - <a href="http://tumblr.austinkleon.com/post/127653191446">Marshall McLuhan</a><br></p>
      <p>When the journey is predictable and the road is well-travelled, a map is optimal. For creative expeditions, you must blaze your own trail, sometimes taking the <a href="http://www.frankchimero.com/writing/the-long-hard-stupid-way/">long, hard, stupid road</a>.</p>

      <p><b>Making is thinking</b><br>
      <i>"You've got to get sh*t happening – you can talk about it, you can write it down, it means nothing until you actually make it and think f**k that's nothing like what I thought it was going to be! That happens most of the time.”</i> - <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2009/jan/29/gameculture">Gary Penn</a><br></p>
      <p>It's not real until you can touch it. Have a bias towards action.</p>

      <p><small><sup>*</sup><i>Note: These are strong ideas, loosely held. Like McLuhan, I’m completely ready to <a href="http://tumblr.seantaylor.work/post/127940112295/im-making-explorations-i-dont-know-where">"junk any statement I’ve ever made about any subject"</a>.</i></small></p>

      <p>Thanks for visiting,<br>Sean</p>
