							<h3>Experience</h3>
						</header>
						<p>The Producers was founded by <a href="https://ae.linkedin.com/in/mrseantaylor">Sean Taylor</a> to solve a problem for clients that kept cropping up in his previous life as Executive Producer at BAFTA-winning game studio, Denki - whilst play becomes more pervasive a lot of organisations struggle when they turn their hand to making games, or even their products more playful.</p>
						<p>Making a game isn't complicated, it's just hard. To succeed you need a compass, a sherpa, an <a href="https://ae.linkedin.com/in/mrseantaylor">impresario</a>. Your multiplier for execution.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<blockquote>To me, ideas are worth nothing unless executed. They are just a multiplier. Execution is worth millions.<br><br>
						The most brilliant idea, with no execution, is worth $20. The most brilliant idea takes great execution to be worth $20,000,000. That's why I don't want to hear people's ideas. I'm not interested until I see their execution.<br><br><a href="https://sivers.org/multiply">Derek Sivers</a></blockquote>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>In a 20 year career, Sean has produced over 50 interactive entertainment apps. Some have won <a href+"http://www.bafta.org/scotland/awards/ceremony/nominees-winners/british-academy-scotland-awards-winners-in-2011#jump10">BAFTAs</a>, some have went on to become the <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2013/9/20/4752380/grand-theft-auto-5-hits-1-billion-in-three-days-sets-new-record">biggest entertainment franchise in the world</a>, but all shipped to time, budget and quality expectations. Because he's a multiplier for execution.</p>
